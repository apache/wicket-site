title: Apache Wicket 6.2.0 released
---

The Apache Wicket PMC is proud to announce Apache Wicket 6.2.0!

This release marks the second minor release of Wicket 6. Starting
with Wicket 6 we use semantic versioning for the future development of
Wicket, and as such no API breaks are present in this release compared
to 6.0.0.

New and noteworthy
------------------

SerializableChecker has been made easier to extend. It is now much easier
to add your own checks at serialization time. For example, check whether your
LoadableDetachableModels are detached, or no Hibernate entities are referenced
directly from your component tree, etc.

For the full changelog see the release notes attached to the end of
this announcement.

Using this release
------------------

With Apache Maven update your dependency to (and don't forget to
update any other dependencies on Wicket projects to the same version):

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.wicket</groupId>
    <artifactId>wicket-core</artifactId>
    <version>6.2.0</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

Or download and build the distribution yourself, or use our
convenience binary package

 * Binary: [6.2.0 binary download](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/wicket/6.2.0/binaries)

Upgrading from earlier versions
-------------------------------

If you upgrade from 6.0.0 or 6.1.0, this release is a drop in 
replacement. If you come from a version prior to 6.0.0, please 
read our Wicket 6 migration guide found at [http://s.apache.org/wicket-6.0-migration](http://s.apache.org/wicket-6.0-migration)

Have fun!
