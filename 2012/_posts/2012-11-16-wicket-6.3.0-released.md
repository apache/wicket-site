title: Apache Wicket 6.3.0 released
---

The Apache Wicket PMC is proud to announce Apache Wicket 6.3.0!

This release marks the third minor release of Wicket 6. Starting
with Wicket 6 we use semantic versioning for the future development of
Wicket, and as such no API breaks are present in this release compared
to 6.0.0.

New and noteworthy
------------------

This release fixes some javascript errors in IE7 and IE8 with Wicket 6.

We have upgraded the embedded JQuery library to 1.8.2 (the most recent
stable release of JQuery). If you depend on an earlier version of
JQuery, you can instruct Wicket to use your older version. See the
[Wicket Ajax Guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WICKET/Wicket+Ajax#WicketAjax-Configuration)
for more information.

For the full changelog see the release notes attached to the end of
this announcement.

Using this release
------------------

With Apache Maven update your dependency to (and don't forget to
update any other dependencies on Wicket projects to the same version):

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.wicket</groupId>
    <artifactId>wicket-core</artifactId>
    <version>6.3.0</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

Or download and build the distribution yourself, or use our
convenience binary package

 * Binary: [6.3.0 binary download](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/wicket/6.3.0/binaries)

Upgrading from earlier versions
-------------------------------

If you upgrade from 6.0.0, 6.1.0, or 6.2.0 this release is a drop in 
replacement. If you come from a version prior to 6.0.0, please 
read our Wicket 6 migration guide found at [http://s.apache.org/wicket-6.0-migration](http://s.apache.org/wicket-6.0-migration)
