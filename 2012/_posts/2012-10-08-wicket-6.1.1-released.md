title: Apache Wicket 6.1.1 released
---

The Apache Wicket PMC is proud to announce Apache Wicket 6.1.1!

This release marks the first patch release of Wicket 6. Starting with Wicket 
6 we use semantic versioning for the future development of Wicket, and as
such no API breaks are present in this release compared to 6.1.0 and 6.0.0.

This release fixes two bugs in 6.1.0:

[WICKET-4789](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET-4789)

The way URLs are encoded was changed (WICKET-4645) and now the first
request (with ;jsessionid in path) generates invalid internal links.

[WICKET-4759](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET-4759)

FilterForm/FilterToolbar don't work when there's more than one IColumn
to be filtered

Any other issues will be released in 6.2.0

Using this release
------------------

With Apache Maven update your dependency to (and don't forget to
update any other dependencies on Wicket projects to the same version):

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.wicket</groupId>
    <artifactId>wicket-core</artifactId>
    <version>6.1.1</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

Upgrading from earlier versions
-------------------------------

If you upgrade from 6.0.0 or 6.1.0, this release is a drop in 
replacement. If you come from a version prior to 6.0.0, please 
read our Wicket 6 migration guide found at [http://s.apache.org/wicket-6.0-migration](http://s.apache.org/wicket-6.0-migration)

Have fun!
