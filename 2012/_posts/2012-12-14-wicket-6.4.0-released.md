title: Apache Wicket 6.4.0 released
---

The Apache Wicket PMC is proud to announce Apache Wicket 6.4.0!

This release marks the fourth minor release of Wicket 6. Starting
with Wicket 6 we use semantic versioning for the future development of
Wicket, and as such no API breaks are present in this release compared
to 6.0.0.

### New and noteworthy

JQuery was upgraded to 1.8.3, bootstrap to 2.2.2.

#### JSR 303 BeanValidation support

Native support for BeanValidation (JSR 303) was added as an 
experimental module and released as version 0.5. You can grab it
by using these maven coordinates:

 * org.apache.wicket:wicket-bean-validation:0.5:jar

or by pasting in the pom snippet below:

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.wicket</groupId>
    <artifactId>wicket-bean-validation</artifactId>
    <version>0.5</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

Note that this is an experimental module and that it is not released
under the SemVer rules. Use at your own risk.

#### Hierarchical feedback panel

A new kind of feedback panel was introduced: a hierarchical feedback
panel. A specialized feedback panel that only displays messages from
inside a fence defined by a container component. Instances will not
show messages coming from inside a nested fence, allowing the nesting
of these panels to work correctly without displaying the same
feedback message twice. A constructor that does not takes a fencing
component creates a catch-all panel that shows messages that do not
come from inside any fence or from the Session.

For more information see the [FencedFeedbackPanel javadoc](http://s.apache.org/wicket-FencedFeedbackPanel).

For the full changelog see the release notes attached to the end of
this announcement.

### Using this release

With Apache Maven update your dependency to (and don't forget to
update any other dependencies on Wicket projects to the same version):

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.wicket</groupId>
    <artifactId>wicket-core</artifactId>
    <version>6.4.0</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

Or download and build the distribution yourself, or use our
convenience binary package

### Upgrading from earlier versions

If you upgrade from 6.0.0, 6.1.0, 6.2.0 or 6.3.0 this release is a drop in
replacement. If you come from a version prior to 6.0.0, please
read our Wicket 6 migration guide found at
