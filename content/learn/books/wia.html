            <p>Wicket in Action is written by Martijn Dashorst and Eelco Hillenius and is
published by Manning.</p>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>There are dozens of Java frameworks out there, but most of them require you to
learn special coding techniques and new, often rigid, patterns of development.
Wicket is different. As a component-based Web application framework, Wicket
lets you build maintainable enterprise-grade web applications using the power
of plain old Java objects (POJOs), HTML, Ajax, Spring, Hibernate and Maven.
Wicket automatically manages state at the component level, which means no more
awkward HTTPSession objects. Its elegant programming model enables you to
write rich web applications quickly.</p>

<p>Wicket in Action is the authoritative, comprehensive guide for Java developers
building Wicket-based Web applications. This book starts with an introduction
to Wicket’s structure and components, and moves quickly into examples of
Wicket at work. Written by two of the project’s earliest and most
authoritative experts, this book shows you both the “how-to” and the “why” of
Wicket. As you move through the book, you’ll learn to use and customize Wicket
components, how to interact with other technologies like Spring and Hibernate,
and how to build rich, Ajax-driven features into your applications.</p>

<h3 id="authors">Authors</h3>

<p>Martijn Dashorst is a software engineer with over 10 years of experience in
software development. He has been actively involved in the Wicket project
since it was open sourced, and has presented Wicket as a speaker at numerous
conferences, including JavaOne and JavaPolis.</p>

<p>Eelco Hillenius is an experienced software developer who has been part of
Wicket’s core team almost from the start. He works for Teachscape where he
helping to build the next elearning platform. A Dutch native, he currently
lives in Seattle.</p>
