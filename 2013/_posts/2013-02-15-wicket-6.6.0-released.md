title: Apache Wicket 6.6.0 released
---

The Apache Wicket PMC is proud to announce Apache Wicket 6.6.0!

This release marks the sixth minor release of Wicket 6. Starting
with Wicket 6 we use semantic versioning for the future development of
Wicket, and as such no API breaks are present in this release compared
to 6.0.0.

### New and noteworthy

#### wicket:for attribute for html label tags

While already available for some time, the wicket-1.5.xsd now contains
a valid definition for the `wicket:for` attribute such that it 

> Can be used in HTML `<label>` element to automatically link it
> to a form element. The value of this attribute must have the same value of
> the form component's wicket:id attribute.

So you can use the following markup:

{% highlight html %}
<label wicket:for="someinput">Some label</label>
<input wicket:id="someinput" type="text">
{% endhighlight %}

#### Added a callback for an invalidated session

Session is extended with a life cycle event called `onInvalidate()`.
This method is executed when the user session is invalidated either
by explicit call to `org.apache.wicket.Session#invalidate()` or due
to HttpSession expiration.

In case of session expiration this method is called in a non-worker
thread, i.e. there are no thread locals exported for the Application,
RequestCycle and Session. The Session is the current instance. The
Application can be found by using `Application#get(String)`. There is
no way to get a reference to a RequestCycle.

### Using this release

With Apache Maven update your dependency to (and don't forget to
update any other dependencies on Wicket projects to the same version):

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.wicket</groupId>
    <artifactId>wicket-core</artifactId>
    <version>6.6.0</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

Or download and build the distribution yourself, or use our
convenience binary package
