title: Apache Wicket 6.11.0 released
---

The Apache Wicket PMC is proud to announce Apache Wicket 6.11.0!

This release marks the eleventh minor release of Wicket 6. Starting
with Wicket 6 we use semantic versioning for the future development
of Wicket, and as such no API breaks are present in this release
compared to 6.0.0.

### New and noteworthy

#### New HTML5Attributes behavior

HTML5 attribute support in Wicket continues to be improved upon. Add
the new HTML5Attributes behavior to your text fields or buttons and
Wicket will add the relevant HTML5 attributes based on the state of
your components:

 - adds "required" if your form component is required
 - adds "placeholder" for the label of your form component
 - adds "pattern" if your form component has a PatternValidator 
   attached
 - adds "formnovalidate" if your button has default form processing 
   set to false

This behavior replaces the functionality from 6.10 where HTML5
attributes were added automatically (see
[WICKET-5289](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET-5289) and
[WICKET-5331](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET-5331))

#### BeanValidation receives french translation

The BeanValidation project now has a french translation for
validation errors:

 - Le champ '${label}' ne doit pas être null
 - Le champ '${label}' pourrait contenir du contenu HTML dangereux

Bonne chance!

### JQuery update in 6.9.0

As of Wicket 6.9 we ship JQuery 1.10.1. The JQuery project has
decided to remove deprecated APIs from their codebase from JQuery 1.9
and up. This means that JQuery plugins using these deprecated APIs no
longer work. See the JQuery migration guide for more information,
available from http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/

If your application depends on these deprecated APIs you can easily
downgrade to JQuery 1.8.3-the previously provided JQuery that still
contains these APIs. Download the 1.8.3 release of jquery and add it
to your project in its application's init method:

{% highlight java %}
    @Override
    protected void init() {
        getJavaScriptLibrarySettings()
            .setJQueryReference(yourJquery183ResourceReference);
    }
{% endhighlight %}

### CDI injection issue

In the CDI releases of Weld 2.0.1 and prior, it was assumed that
injection in anonymous inner classes was not legal and when
attempted, it resulted in an exception:

{% highlight text %}
Caused by: org.jboss.weld.exceptions.DefinitionException:
WELD-000070 Simple bean [EnhancedAnnotatedTypeImpl] private class
com.example.HomePage$AForm cannot be a non-static inner class
{% endhighlight %}

This was reported as
[WICKET-5226](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET-5226), as
it became an issue in Glassfish 4, which ships with Weld 2.0.1 (or
earlier). We implemented a fix for this particular issue by not
injecting into anonymous inner classes.

Unfortunately this was not a bug that needed fixing on our part, but
rather in the Weld framework (see
[WELD-1441](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-1441))

Therefore we reverted the commits done for WICKET-5226 and hope that
Glassfish will upgrade their Weld implementation soon. For the whole
story read
[WICKET-5264](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET-5264)

Glassfish has fixed this in trunk according to
[GLASSFISH-20619](https://java.net/jira/browse/GLASSFISH-20619) but
the fix has yet to be integrated into a release.

### Using this release

With Apache Maven update your dependency to (and don't forget to
update any other dependencies on Wicket projects to the same version):

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.wicket</groupId>
    <artifactId>wicket-core</artifactId>
    <version>6.11.0</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

Or download and build the distribution yourself, or use our
convenience binary package

### Upgrading from earlier versions

If you upgrade from 6.y.z this release is a drop in replacement. If
