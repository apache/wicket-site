title: Apache Wicket 6.12.0 released
---

The Apache Wicket PMC is proud to announce Apache Wicket 6.12.0!

This release marks the twelfth minor release of Wicket 6. Starting
with Wicket 6 we use semantic versioning for the future development
of Wicket, and as such no API breaks are present in this release
compared to 6.0.0.

### New and noteworthy

This release fixes 16 bugs and adds the following improvements:

 * Support MultiFileUploadField in FormTester
 * Add support for parsing IE 11 user agent
 * Log the exception if the application cannot start properly
 * Add Wicket.Event.unsubscribe method
 * Allow form components to trim the input themselves
 * Allow DebugBar contributors to be removed
 * Session management doesn't work with Jetty's JDBCSessionManager 
 * HeaderItem to be Serializable

### JQuery update in 6.9.0

As of Wicket 6.9 we ship JQuery 1.10.1. The JQuery project has
decided to remove deprecated APIs from their codebase from JQuery 1.9
and up. This means that JQuery plugins using these deprecated APIs no
longer work. See the JQuery migration guide for more information,
available from http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/

If your application depends on these deprecated APIs you can easily
downgrade to JQuery 1.8.3-the previously provided JQuery that still
contains these APIs. Download the 1.8.3 release of jquery and add it
to your project in its application's init method:

{% highlight java %}
 @Override
 protected void init() {
     getJavaScriptLibrarySettings()
         .setJQueryReference(yourJquery183ResourceReference);
 }
{% endhighlight %}

### CDI injection issue

In the CDI releases of Weld 2.0.1 and prior, it was assumed that
injection in anonymous inner classes was not legal and when
attempted, it resulted in an exception:

{% highlight text %}
Caused by: org.jboss.weld.exceptions.DefinitionException:
WELD-000070 Simple bean [EnhancedAnnotatedTypeImpl] private class
com.example.HomePage$AForm cannot be a non-static inner class
{% endhighlight %}

This was reported as
[WICKET-5226](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET-5226), as
it became an issue in Glassfish 4, which ships with Weld 2.0.1 (or
earlier). We implemented a fix for this particular issue by not
injecting into anonymous inner classes.

Unfortunately this was not a bug that needed fixing on our part, but
rather in the Weld framework (see
[WELD-1441](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-1441))

Therefore we reverted the commits done for WICKET-5226 and hope that
Glassfish will upgrade their Weld implementation soon. For the whole
story read
[WICKET-5264](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET-5264)

Glassfish has fixed this in trunk according to
[GLASSFISH-20619](https://java.net/jira/browse/GLASSFISH-20619) but
the fix has yet to be integrated into a release.

### Using this release

With Apache Maven update your dependency to (and don't forget to
update any other dependencies on Wicket projects to the same version):

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
 <groupId>org.apache.wicket</groupId>
 <artifactId>wicket-core</artifactId>
 <version>6.12.0</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

Or download and build the distribution yourself, or use our
convenience binary package
