title: Apache Wicket 6.8.0 released
---

The Apache Wicket PMC is proud to announce Apache Wicket 6.8.0!

This release marks the eighth minor release of Wicket 6. Starting
with Wicket 6 we use semantic versioning for the future development
of Wicket, and as such no API breaks are present in this release
compared to 6.0.0.

### Using this release

With Apache Maven update your dependency to (and don't forget to
update any other dependencies on Wicket projects to the same version):

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.wicket</groupId>
    <artifactId>wicket-core</artifactId>
    <version>6.8.0</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

Or download and build the distribution yourself, or use our
convenience binary package

 * Source: [6.8.0 source download](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/wicket/6.8.0)
 * Binary: [6.8.0 binary download](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/wicket/6.8.0/binaries)

### Upgrading from earlier versions

If you upgrade from 6.y.z this release is a drop in replacement. If
you come from a version prior to 6.0.0, please read our Wicket 6
migration guide found at

Have fun!
