title: Apache Wicket 6.10.0 released
---

The Apache Wicket PMC is proud to announce Apache Wicket 6.10.0!

This release marks the tenth minor release of Wicket 6. Starting with
Wicket 6 we use semantic versioning for the future development of
Wicket, and as such no API breaks are present in this release
compared to 6.0.0.

### New and noteworthy

* Required text form components now emit the HTML5 required attribute

* URLs with username/passwords in them will now be parsed correctly
  http://me:secret@localhost and http://me:secret@localhost:8080 will
  no longer trigger an invalid number exception

* OnEventHeaderItem uses JavaScript event registration, instead of
  inline DOM attributes, so it should remove 'on' prefixes when it is
  provided by the user application. For example: onclick => click.
  
### JQuery update in 6.9.0

As of Wicket 6.9 we ship JQuery 1.10.1. The JQuery project has
decided to remove deprecated APIs from their codebase from JQuery 1.9
and up. This means that JQuery plugins using these deprecated APIs no
longer work. See the JQuery migration guide for more information,
available from http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/ 

If your application depends on these deprecated APIs you can easily
downgrade to JQuery 1.8.3-the previously provided JQuery that still
contains these APIs. Download the 1.8.3 release of jquery and add it
to your project in its application's init method:

{% highlight java %}
@Override 
protected void init() {
    getJavaScriptLibrarySettings()
        .setJQueryReference(yourJquery183ResourceReference);
}
{% endhighlight %}

### CDI injection issue

In the CDI releases of Weld 2.0.1 and prior, it was assumed that
injection in anonymous inner classes was not legal and when
attempted, it resulted in an exception:

{% highlight text %}
Caused by: org.jboss.weld.exceptions.DefinitionException: WELD-000070
Simple bean [EnhancedAnnotatedTypeImpl] private class
com.example.HomePage$AForm cannot be a non-static inner class
{% endhighlight %}

This was reported as
[WICKET-5226](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET-5226), as
it became an issue in Glassfish 4, which ships with Weld 2.0.1 (or
earlier). We implemented a fix for this particular issue by not
injecting into anonymous inner classes.

Unfortunately this was not a bug that needed fixing on our part, but
rather in the Weld framework (see
[WELD-1441](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-1441))

Therefore we reverted the commits done for WICKET-5226 and hope that
Glassfish will upgrade their Weld implementation soon. For the whole
story read
[WICKET-5264](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET-5264)
  

### Using this release

With Apache Maven update your dependency to (and don't forget to
update any other dependencies on Wicket projects to the same version):

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.wicket</groupId>
    <artifactId>wicket-core</artifactId>
    <version>6.10.0</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

Or download and build the distribution yourself, or use our
convenience binary package

### Upgrading from earlier versions
