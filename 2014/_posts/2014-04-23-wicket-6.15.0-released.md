title: Apache Wicket 6.15.0 released
---

The Apache Wicket PMC is proud to announce Apache Wicket 6.15.0!

This release marks the fifteenth minor release of Wicket 6. Starting
with Wicket 6 we use semantic versioning for the future development of
Wicket, and as such no API breaks are present in this release compared
to 6.0.0.

### New and noteworthy

This release fixes 25 bugs and adds the following improvements:

 * The second level page store has been disabled by default (see issue [WICKET-5554](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET-5554) for more details).
 * Created new placeholder tag to indicate where header contributions should appear. See this [blog post entry](http://wicketinaction.com/2014/03/header-contributions-positioning/) or paragraph 15.8 of the official guide. 

This release also celebrates the 10th birthday of Wicket!
