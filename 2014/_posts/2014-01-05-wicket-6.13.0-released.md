title: Apache Wicket 6.13.0 released
---

The Apache Wicket PMC is proud to announce Apache Wicket 6.13.0!

This release marks the thirteenth minor release of Wicket 6. Starting
with Wicket 6 we use semantic versioning for the future development of
Wicket, and as such no API breaks are present in this release compared
to 6.0.0.

### New and noteworthy

This release fixes 25 bugs and adds the following improvements:

 * Online Wicket User guide (see below)
 * CDI 1.1 support (see below)
 * JQuery upgraded from 1.10.1 to 1.10.2
 * Implemented BigIntegerConverter
 * Migrate Wicket-Atmosphere to Atmosphere 2

### Online Wicket reference guide

After many years of people asking for a reference guide for Apache
Wicket we finally were able to add one to our site thanks to Andrea del
Bene and comSysto for writing the guide and providing the hours of
converting it to our site.

You can read the manual in 3 forms: multi page HTML, single page HTML
and PDF.

The contents:

 - Introduction
 - How to use the example code
 - Why should I learn Wicket?
 - Wicket says "Hello, World!"
 - Wicket as page layout manager
 - Keeping control over HTML
 - Component Lifecycle
 - Page versioning and caching
 - Under the hood of request processing
 - Wicket Links and URL generation
 - Wicket models and forms
 - Wicket forms in detail
 - Displaying multiple items with repeaters
 - Internationalization with Wicket
 - Resource management with Wicket
 - An example of integration with JavaScript
 - Wicket advanced topics

### New CDI-1.1 integration project

A new (experimental) module for CDI integration was added to support
CDI 1.1 with Wicket. As CDI 1.0 and 1.1 are different beasts and not
compatible, we had to craft a new module with specific support for the
new CDI standard. The module is still experimental, but we expect to
make it a default module in a couple of releases.

You can use the new Wicket CDI module by including the following
dependency in your POM:

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.wicket</groupId>
	<artifactId>wicket-cdi-1.1</artifactId>
	<version>0.2</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

Note that you have to remove the old wicket-cdi module and the Seam
conversation dependency: `org.jboss.seam.conversation:seam-conversation-weld`

For more information about what is new in CDI 1.1 read [this blog post
by Pete Muir](http://s.apache.org/newincdi11).

### JQuery update in 6.9.0

As of Wicket 6.9 we ship JQuery 1.10.1 (since 6.13.0 we ship 1.10.2).
The JQuery project has decided to remove deprecated APIs from their
codebase from JQuery 1.9 and up. This means that JQuery plugins using
these deprecated APIs no longer work. See the JQuery migration guide
for more information, available from [the JQuery web
site](http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/)

If your application depends on these deprecated APIs you can easily
downgrade to JQuery 1.8.3-the previously provided JQuery that still
contains these APIs. Download the 1.8.3 release of jquery and add it
to your project in its application's init method:

{% highlight java %}
 @Override
 protected void init() {
     getJavaScriptLibrarySettings()
         .setJQueryReference(yourJquery183ResourceReference);
 }
{% endhighlight %}

### CDI injection issue

In the CDI releases of Weld 2.0.1 and prior, it was assumed that
injection in anonymous inner classes was not legal and when
attempted, it resulted in an exception:

{% highlight text %}
Caused by: org.jboss.weld.exceptions.DefinitionException:
WELD-000070 Simple bean [EnhancedAnnotatedTypeImpl] private class
com.example.HomePage$AForm cannot be a non-static inner class
{% endhighlight %}

This was reported as
[WICKET-5226](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET-5226), as
it became an issue in Glassfish 4, which ships with Weld 2.0.1 (or
earlier). We implemented a fix for this particular issue by not
injecting into anonymous inner classes.

Unfortunately this was not a bug that needed fixing on our part, but
rather in the Weld framework (see
[WELD-1441](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-1441))

Therefore we reverted the commits done for WICKET-5226 and hope that
Glassfish will upgrade their Weld implementation soon. For the whole
story read
[WICKET-5264](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET-5264)

Glassfish has fixed this in trunk according to
[GLASSFISH-20619](https://java.net/jira/browse/GLASSFISH-20619) but
the fix has yet to be integrated into a release.

### Using this release

With Apache Maven update your dependency to (and don't forget to
update any other dependencies on Wicket projects to the same version):

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
 <groupId>org.apache.wicket</groupId>
 <artifactId>wicket-core</artifactId>
 <version>6.13.0</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

Or download and build the distribution yourself, or use our
convenience binary package

### Upgrading from earlier versions

If you upgrade from 6.y.z this release is a drop in replacement. If
you come from a version prior to 6.0.0, please read our Wicket 6
