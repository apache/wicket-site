The Apache Wicket PMC is proud to announce Apache Wicket 6.16.0!

This release marks the sixteenth minor release of Wicket 6. Starting
with Wicket 6 we use semantic versioning for the future development of
Wicket, and as such no API breaks are present in this release compared
to 6.0.0.

### New and noteworthy

This release fixes 15 bugs and adds the following improvements:

 * Upgrade JQuery to latest releases - 1.11.1 & 2.1.1
 * Upgrade Atmosphere to latest version
 * Generation of wicket ids with prefix / suffix
 * Introduce CharSequenceResource similar to ByteArrayResource

The full list of improvements and fixes can be found at the end of this
announcement.
