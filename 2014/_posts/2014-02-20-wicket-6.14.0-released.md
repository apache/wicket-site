title: Apache Wicket 6.14.0 released
---

The Apache Wicket PMC is proud to announce Apache Wicket 6.14.0!

This release marks the fourteenth minor release of Wicket 6. Starting
with Wicket 6 we use semantic versioning for the future development of
Wicket, and as such no API breaks are present in this release compared
to 6.0.0.

### New and noteworthy

This release fixes 34 bugs and adds the following improvements:

 * JQuery upgraded from 1.10.2 to 1.11.0
 * Fix for [CVE-2014-0043](/news/2014/02/21/cve-2014-0043.html)
 * Wicket Session may not be saved in the SessionStore (Http Session) under some conditions and lead to lost state
 * Update classes copied from commons-fileupload to fix CVE-2014-0050
 * Allow &lt;script&gt; tags to have children components to be able to use client side templating



### Using this release

With Apache Maven update your dependency to (and don't forget to
update any other dependencies on Wicket projects to the same version):

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>

 <artifactId>wicket-core</artifactId>
 <version>6.14.0</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}
