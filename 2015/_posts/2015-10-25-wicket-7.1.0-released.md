title: Apache Wicket 7.1.0 released
---

The Apache Wicket PMC is proud to announce Apache Wicket 7.1.0!

This release marks another minor release of Wicket 7. We
use semantic versioning for the development of Wicket, and as such no
API breaks are present breaks are present in this release compared to
7.0.0.

#### New and noteworthy

Significant improvement in performance while adding components to
the component hierarchy. There was a regression in performance
introduced by component queuing. The algorithm checked if there were
any components to be dequeued, but did so in a O(n^2) way. This was
fixed.

Upon further investigation we found that adding components is O(n^2)
since 1.3 (when memory was scarce and expensive). We fixed that and
made it roughly O(1).

This means that when you have a page with 10k components on it, the
adding won't slow you down any more, and the new way of adding
components will scrape a few ms off your overall average response time.

This release also fixes several bugs where head sections were not rendered,
i18n JavaScript resources could not be loaded, Range: header parsing and
a couple of component queuing issues.

#### Using this release

With Apache Maven update your dependency to (and don't forget to
update any other dependencies on Wicket projects to the same version):

    <artifactId>wicket-core</artifactId>
    <version>7.1.0</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}
