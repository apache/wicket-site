title: Apache Wicket 7.0.0-M6 released
---
The Apache Wicket PMC is proud to announce Apache Wicket 7.0.0-M6!

We have released another milestone release for Apache Wicket 7. We aim
to finalise Wicket 7 over the coming months and request your help in
testing the new major version.

### Caveats

It is still a development version so expect API breaks to happen over
the course of the coming milestone releases.

### Semantic versioning

As we adopted semver Wicket 7 will be the first release since 6.0 where
we are able to refactor the API. We will continue to use semver when we
have made Wicket 7 final and maintain api compatibility between minor
versions of Wicket 7.

### Requirements

Wicket 7 requires the following:

 - Java 7
 - Servlet 3 compatible container

You can't mix wicket libraries from prior Wicket versions with Wicket 7.

### Migration guide

As usual we have a migration guide available online for people
migrating their applications to Wicket 7. We will continue to update
the guide as development progresses. If you find something that is not
in the guide, please update the guide, or let us know so we can update
the guide.

You can find the guide here: [http://s.apache.org/wicket7migrate](http://s.apache.org/wicket7migrate)

### New and noteworthy

- New inline image support for the new data: protocol. See
http://ci.apache.org/projects/wicket/apidocs/6.x/org/apache/wicket/markup/html/image/InlineImage.html
for more information.

- Added CSRF prevention measure to Wicket. The
CsrfPreventionRequestCycleListener
(http://ci.apache.org/projects/wicket/apidocs/6.x/org/apache/wicket/protocol/http/CsrfPreventionRequestCycleListener.html)
will prevent requests coming from other origins than allowed from
performing actions. See the JavaDoc for more information on this
listener.

- JQuery was upgraded to most recent version.

### Using this release

With Apache Maven update your dependency to (and don't forget to
update any other dependencies on Wicket projects to the same version):
