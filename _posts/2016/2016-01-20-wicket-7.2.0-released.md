title: Apache Wicket 7.2.0 released
---

The Apache Wicket PMC is proud to announce Apache Wicket 7.2.0!

This release marks another minor release of Wicket 7. We
use semantic versioning for the development of Wicket, and as such no
API breaks are present breaks are present in this release compared to
7.0.0.

#### New and noteworthy

In this version two new features have been implemented. The first
features is to read resources from out of file systems with Java's
NIO API, which also allows you to write own file systems.

As an example you can read audio files from within a folder of
a ZIP file without extracting it and stream it directly to the
client.

The second feature is to load images from external servers.

In addition a lot of bugs has been fixed regarding ajax and enclosures.


#### Using this release

With Apache Maven update your dependency to (and don't forget to
update any other dependencies on Wicket projects to the same version):

    <groupId>org.apache.wicket</groupId>
    <artifactId>wicket-core</artifactId>
    <version>7.2.0</version>
</dependency>
