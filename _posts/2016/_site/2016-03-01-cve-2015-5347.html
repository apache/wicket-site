<p>Severity: Important</p>

<p>Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation</p>

<p>Versions Affected:
Apache Wicket 1.5.x, 6.x and 7.x</p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>It is possible for JavaScript statements to break out of a ModalWindow’s 
title - only quotes are escaped in the JavaScript settings object, allowing JavaScript
to be injected into the markup.</p>

<p>This might pose a security threat if the written JavaScript contains user provided data.</p>

<p>The title is now escaped by default, this can be disabled explicitly via
  modalWindow.setEscapeModelStrings(false).</p>
