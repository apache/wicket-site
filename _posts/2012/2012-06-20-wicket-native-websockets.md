title: Wicket Native WebSockets support
---

A new experimental module just landed in Wicket's Git repository - Wicket Native WebSocket.
It provides the support for HTML5 WebSockets in Wicket as the one for Ajax that you may already use in your applications.

The full documentation is available at [Native WebSocket Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/0vSoAQ)
A demo application is available at [Martin Grigorov's GitHub](https://github.com/martin-g/wicket-native-websocket-example)

Any feedback about the new module, its implementation and its documentation is very welcome!
Just ask your question in Wicket's mailing lists or IRC channel.

The Wicket team!
