title: Apache Wicket 10.0.0-M1 released
---
The Apache Wicket PMC is proud to announce Apache Wicket 10.0.0-M1!

Apache Wicket is an open source Java component oriented web application
framework that powers thousands of web applications and web sites for
governments, stores, universities, cities, banks, email providers, and
more. You can find more about Apache Wicket at https://wicket.apache.org

This release marks another minor release of Wicket 10. We
use semantic versioning for the development of Wicket, and as such no
API breaks are present in this release compared to 10.0.0.

New and noteworthy
------------------

**Java 17 support**

The new milestone requires Java 17 as minimum version. 

**Automatic migration tool**

Apache Wicket 10 provides automatic migration based on OpenRewrite. See migration guide for more details: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WICKET/Migration+to+Wicket+10.0#MigrationtoWicket10.0-Automaticmigration

Using this release
------------------

With Apache Maven update your dependency to (and don't forget to
update any other dependencies on Wicket projects to the same version):

{% highlight xml%}
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.wicket</groupId>
    <artifactId>wicket-core</artifactId>
    <version>10.0.0-M1</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight%}

Or download and build the distribution yourself, or use our
convenience binary package you can find here:

Upgrading from earlier versions
