title: A Quick Tour of Wicket
---
Nothing says more about a development technology than a few simple examples.
After all, how hard should it be to do something easy? The examples below
should speak for themselves in demonstrating how easy it is to get things done
in Wicket when compared to other frameworks. You will discover that Wicket's
component-oriented structure and its "low touch" approach to HTML is quite
inviting.

## For beginners

Wicket comes with a collection of examples meant to help you understand the basic concepts of the framework. They are particularly helpful if you are new to Wicket and you are reading our [User Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/learn/#guide). 
You can see these examples and many more in [live action](http://examples9x.wicket.apache.org/index.html) 
(available also for version [8.x](http://examples8x.wicket.apache.org/index.html), [7.x](http://examples7x.wicket.apache.org/index.html) and [6.x](http://examples6x.wicket.apache.org/index.html)) without having to install anything.

The following list contains a full description for some of these examples:

* [Hello World!](helloworld.html) - Everybody's favorite example
* [Navomatic](navomatic.html) - Automatic navigation using Borders and Links
* [GuestBook](guestbook.html) - A tiny blogger demonstrating ListViews and
  Forms

* [Ajax Counter](ajaxcounter.html) - A short example explaining Wicket's Ajax
  features building a counter.
