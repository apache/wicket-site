Enjoying Web Development with Wicket is written by Kent Tong and is self
published.

## Description ##

If you'd like to create AJAX web-based applications easily, then this book is
for you. More importantly, it shows you how to do that with joy and feel good
about your own work! You don't need to know servlet or JSP while your
productivity will be much higher than using servlet or JSP directly. This is
possible because we're going to use a library called Wicket that makes
complicated stuff simple and elegant.

How does it do that? First, it allows the web designer to work on the static
contents and design of a page while allowing the developer to work on the
dynamic contents of that page without stepping on each other's toes; Second,
it allows developers to work with high level concepts such as objects and
properties instead of HTTP URLs, query parameters or HTML string values;
Third, it comes with powerful components such as calendar, tree and data grid
and it allows you to create your own components for reuse in your own project.

However, don't take our word for it! This book will quickly walk you through
real world use cases to show you how to use Wicket and leave it up to you to
judge.

The manuscript of book has been used to train up a team of programmers who had not used Java or written any program at all. The training took only a few months (six hours per week). Now they are developing a core application for their organization using Wicket, Spring and Hibernate.
