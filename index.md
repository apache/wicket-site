<div class="l-full l-first preamble">
    <h1 id="introduction">Introducing Apache&nbsp;Wicket</h1>
    <p>Invented in 2004, Wicket is one of the few survivors of the Java
    serverside web framework wars of the mid 2000's. Wicket is an open
    source, component oriented, serverside, Java web application framework.
    With a history of over a decade, it is still going strong and has a
    solid future ahead. Learn why you should consider Wicket for your next
    web application.</p>

        <h3>Just Java &amp; HTML</h3>
        <p>Leverage what you know about Java or your favourite HTML 
        editor to write Wicket applications. With pure Java code and HTML 
        markup Wicket is the go-to web framework for purists.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="l-one-third">
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/wicket-safe.png" class="l-full">
        <h3>Secure by Default</h3>
        <p>URLs do not expose sensitive information and all component paths are
        session-relative. Wicket keeps your model private except those parts
        you explicitly expose.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="l-one-third">
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/wicket-components.png" class="l-full">
        <h3>AJAX Components</h3>
        <p>Write Ajax applications without having to write a single line 
        of JavaScript code. Wicket's Ajax functionality makes it trivial 
        to update selected parts of a UI, and comes with a great selection 
        of basic Ajax components.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="l-first">
    <div class="l-one-third">
        <h3>Open Source with Apache License</h3>
        <p>Since its inception in 2004 Wicket has been an open source
        project and remains available under one of the most permissive
        licenses: the Apache Software License.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="l-one-third">
        <h3>Maintainable code</h3>
        <p>Pages and Components in Wicket are real Java objects that support
        encapsulation, inheritance and events. Create high level components
        with ease and bundle its stylesheets, JavaScript and other resources
        into one reusable package.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="l-one-third">
        <h3>Internationalized to take on the world</h3>
        <p>With support of over 25 languages out-of-the-box, Wicket let's 
        you get started in your own language, or a second language with no 
        effort. You can provide alternative languages on the application, 
        page, or even component level.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="l-first">
    <div class="l-one-third">
        <h3>Multi-tab and window support</h3>
        <p>No more pain while keeping taps on multiple tabs and windows. 
        Wicket's automatic state storage ensures that your users can open 
        pages in new tabs and windows without causing problems.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="l-two-third">
        <h3>Work with JavaScript and CSS</h3>
        <p>Global JavaScript libraries and CSS styling mix properly with 
        component local JavaScript and CSS resources. You can use custom 
        component libraries that ship with default JavaScript behaviour and 
        CSS styling, without having to do anything yourself. Creating such 
        self-contained component libraries is as easy as creating a JAR 
        file.</p>
    </div>

<div class="l-first">
    <div class="l-one-third">
        <h3>Test your pages and components</h3>
        <p>With WicketTester you can achieve testing coverage your QA 
        department can only dream of. Test your pages without having to run 
        inside a browser, or start a container. Test your components directly, 
        check their rendered markup tags, attributes and contents with ease.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="l-one-third">
        <h3>Injection support</h3>
        <p>Inject your services into your pages and components with the 
        technology of your choosing: Wicket provides integration with CDI 
        (JSR-305), Spring and Guice.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="l-one-third">
        <h3>JavaEE integration</h3>
        <p>If you are using the Web profile of JavaEE 6 or newer, you can 
        leverage JPA, EJBs, Bean Validation and CDI with Wicket's integrations 
        for these specifications.</p>
