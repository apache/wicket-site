		<h3>Internationalization</h3>
		<p>With support of over 25 languages out-of-the-box, Wicket let's

			page, or even component level.</p>

		<h3>Ajax components</h3>
		<p>Write Ajax applications without having to write a single line
			of JavaScript code. Wicket's Ajax functionality makes it trivial to
			update selected parts of a UI, and comes with a great selection of
			basic Ajax components.</p>
