<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>There are dozens of Java frameworks out there, but most of them require you to
learn special coding techniques and new, often rigid, patterns of development.
Wicket is different. As a component-based Web application framework, Wicket
lets you build maintainable enterprise-grade web applications using the power
of plain old Java objects (POJOs), HTML, Ajax, Spring, Hibernate and Maven.
Wicket automatically manages state at the component level, which means no more
awkward HTTPSession objects. Its elegant programming model enables you to
write rich web applications quickly.</p>

<p>Wicket in Action is the authoritative, comprehensive guide for Java developers
building Wicket-based Web applications. This book starts with an introduction
to Wicket‚Äôs structure and components, and moves quickly into examples of
Wicket at work. Written by two of the project‚Äôs earliest and most
authoritative experts, this book shows you both the ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù and the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of
Wicket. As you move through the book, you‚Äôll learn to use and customize Wicket
components, how to interact with other technologies like Spring and Hibernate,
and how to build rich, Ajax-driven features into your applications.</p>
