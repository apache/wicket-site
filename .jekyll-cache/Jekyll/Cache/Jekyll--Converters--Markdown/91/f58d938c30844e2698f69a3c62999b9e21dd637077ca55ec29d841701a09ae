I"è	<p>We have released the first of a series of milestone releases for Apache
Wicket 7. We aim to finalise Wicket 7 over the coming months and
request your help in testing the new major version.</p>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<p>It is still a development version so expect API breaks to happen over
the course of the coming milestone releases.</p>

<h3 id="semantic-versioning">Semantic versioning</h3>

<p>As we adopted semver Wicket 7 will be the first release since 6.0 where
we are able to refactor the API. We will continue to use semver when we
have made Wicket 7 final and maintain api compatibility between minor
versions of Wicket 7.</p>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>

<p>Wicket 7 requires the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Java 7</li>
  <li>Servlet 3 compatible container</li>
</ul>

<p>You can‚Äôt mix wicket libraries from prior Wicket versions with Wicket 7.</p>

<h3 id="migration-guide">Migration guide</h3>

<p>As usual we have a migration guide available online for people
migrating their applications to Wicket 7. We will continue to update
the guide as development progresses. If you find something that is not
in the guide, please update the guide, or let us know so we can update
the guide.</p>
