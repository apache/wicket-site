I"?<p>Pedro Santos has been added as a committer and PMC member for Apache Wicket.
Pedro has been increasingly active in the Wicket community in recent months,
and his patches continue to improve in quality. Additionally, Pedro is always
willing to do the “grunt work” of creating great test cases for his patches,
or for JIRA issues that others have attached patches to. Test cases are
invaluable to the development of Wicket because they help us not introduce
regressions as we fix bugs and add features.</p>

<p>Thanks Pedro, and we look forward to working with you!</p>
