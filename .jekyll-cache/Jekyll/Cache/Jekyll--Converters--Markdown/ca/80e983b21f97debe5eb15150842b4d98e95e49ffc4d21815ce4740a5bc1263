I"(<h1 id="reportbug">So you have found a bug‚Ä¶</h1>

<p>As developers we all strive to produce a flawless software. However, in
the real world we might find that our code contains errors or bugs.
Wicket like many other Apache projects uses
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET">JIRA</a> to track bugs and
new feature. If you think you have found a bug follow these simple
steps before opening a new issue on JIRA:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Test the very last version of Wicket to see if the bug was already
fixed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Search <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET">JIRA</a> and the
mailing list to see if it‚Äôs already been discussed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Simply ask to the <a href="mailto:dev@wicket.apache.org">devs</a> mailing list
if you are unsure.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="create-and-set-an-issue-on-jira">Create and set an issue on JIRA</h2>

<p>Either you have spotted a bug or you want to propose a new feature, the
first thing to do is to create and set an issue on JIRA with the
following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Create a new <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET">JIRA
issue</a>. The issue might
alredy exist if you have found a regression.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write a short description of the issue. If this one is a bug, report
the affected version as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="../start/quickstart.html">Create a quickstart</a> that you can use for
prototyping the feature or demonstrating the bug.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="time-for-some-coding">Time for some coding</h2>

<p>Wicket uses Get <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> as versioning system, so you
need to have it properly installed and configured to start work on
Wicket code base. The main git repository is hosted on <a href="https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/wicket.git">Apache git
server</a> but is
mirrored on <a href="https://github.com/apache/wicket">GitHub</a>. To work on
Wicket code you can decide to create a pull request forking the GitHub
mirror or you can clone the official repository and generate a patch
file.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> when you are working on Wicket code, please follow our code
format rules. You can find them <a href="https://github.com/apache/wicket/blob/master/wicket-core/Eclipse
CodeFormat.xml">inside wicket-core
module</a> as Eclipse code formatter profile.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> when you are using Eclipse IDE, please ensure that you have
installed ‚ÄúM2E Settings‚Äù from the Eclipse Marketplace in addition to
the format rules.</p>

<h3 id="github">Create a pull request</h3>

<p>To create a pull request on GitHub follow the instructions you can find
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/">here</a>. Once
you have finished to work on you pull request, send us an email using
<a href="mailto:dev@wicket.apache.org">devs</a> mailing list.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-patch">Create a patch</h3>

<p>If you prefer to work on our main repository, <a href="../start/download.html#snapshots-and-latest-bleeding-edge-code">clone it with
Git</a>
and when you have finished your work create a patch with the following
commands:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="go">git add any_files_you_created_modified_or_deleted
</span><span class="gp">git diff --cached &gt;</span><span class="w"> </span>/tmp/WICKET-NNNN.patch</code></pre></figure>

<p>where NNNN is the issue number. Finally, attach that file
(/tmp/WICKET-NNNN.patch) to the
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET">JIRA</a></p>
