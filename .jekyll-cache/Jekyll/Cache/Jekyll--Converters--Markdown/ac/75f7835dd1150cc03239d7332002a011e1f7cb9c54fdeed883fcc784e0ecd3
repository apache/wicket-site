I"ù<p><em>Severity</em>: Important</p>

<p><em>Vendor</em>: The Apache Software Foundation</p>

<p><em>Versions Affected</em>: Apache Wicket 6.20.0, 6.21.0, 6.22.0, 6.23.0, 6.24.0,
7.0.0, 7.1.0, 7.2.0, 7.3.0, 7.4.0 and 8.0.0-M1</p>

<p><em>Description</em>: Affected versions of Apache Wicket provide a CSRF prevention
measure that fails to discover some cross origin requests. The mitigation is to
not only check the Origin HTTP header, but also take the Referer HTTP header
into account when no Origin was provided. Furthermore, not all Wicket server
side targets were subjected to the CSRF check. This was also fixed.</p>

<p><em>Mitigation</em>: 6.x users should upgrade to 6.25.0, 7.x users should upgrade to
7.5.0 and 8.0.0-M1 users should upgrade to 8.0.0-M2.</p>
