I"¨<p>A new experimental module just landed in Wicketâ€™s Git repository - Wicket Native WebSocket.
It provides the support for HTML5 WebSockets in Wicket as the one for Ajax that you may already use in your applications.</p>

<p>The full documentation is available at <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/0vSoAQ">Native WebSocket Wiki</a>
A demo application is available at <a href="https://github.com/martin-g/wicket-native-websocket-example">Martin Grigorovâ€™s GitHub</a></p>

<p>Any feedback about the new module, its implementation and its documentation is very welcome!
Just ask your question in Wicketâ€™s mailing lists or IRC channel.</p>

<p>The Wicket team!</p>
