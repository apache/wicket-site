I"ã<p>Severity: Important</p>

<p>Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation</p>

<p>Versions Affected:
Apache Wicket 1.5.10 and 6.13.0</p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>By issuing requests to special urls handled by Wicket it is possible to check for the existence of particular classes in the classpath and thus check whether a third party library with a known security vulnerability is in use.</p>

<p>The application developers are recommended to upgrade to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/news/2014/02/06/wicket-1.5.11-released.html">Apache Wicket 1.5.11</a></li>
  <li><a href="/news/2014/02/20/wicket-6.14.0-released.html">Apache Wicket 6.14.0</a></li>
</ul>
