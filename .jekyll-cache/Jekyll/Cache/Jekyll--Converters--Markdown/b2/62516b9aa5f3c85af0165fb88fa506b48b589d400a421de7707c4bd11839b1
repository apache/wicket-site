I"ø<p>The Apache Wicket PMC announces Apache Wicket 6.9.1!</p>

<p>This is a patch release for 6.9.0 where we inadvertently broke CDI
injection into (amongst others) anonymous inner classes. See below
for more information regarding this release.</p>

<p>Please note that this patch release <strong>only</strong> fixes WICKET-5264.</p>

<p>Starting with Wicket 6 we use semantic versioning for the future
development of Wicket, and as such no API breaks are present in this
release compared to 6.0.0.</p>

<h3 id="jquery-update-in-690">JQuery update in 6.9.0</h3>

<p>As of Wicket 6.9 we ship JQuery 1.10.1. The JQuery project has
decided to remove deprecated APIs from their codebase from JQuery 1.9
and up. This means that JQuery plugins using these deprecated APIs no
longer work. See the JQuery migration guide for more information,
available from http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/</p>

<p>If your application depends on these deprecated APIs you can easily
downgrade to JQuery 1.8.3-the previously provided JQuery that still
contains these APIs. Download the 1.8.3 release of jquery and add it
to your project in its applicationâ€™s init method:</p>

<span class="kd">protected</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">init</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">getJavaScriptLibrarySettings</span><span class="o">()</span>
        <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setJQueryReference</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">yourJquery183ResourceReference</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="cdi-injection-issue">CDI injection issue</h3>

<p>In the CDI releases of Weld 2.0.1 and prior, it was assumed that
injection in anonymous inner classes was not legal and when
attempted, it resulted in an exception:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Caused by: org.jboss.weld.exceptions.DefinitionException: WELD-000070
Simple bean [EnhancedAnnotatedTypeImpl] private class
com.example.HomePage$AForm cannot be a non-static inner class</code></pre></figure>

<p>This was reported as
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET-5226">WICKET-5226</a>, as
it became an issue in Glassfish 4, which ships with Weld 2.0.1 (or
earlier). We implemented a fix for this particular issue by not
injecting into anonymous inner classes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this was not a bug that needed fixing on our part, but
rather in the Weld framework (see
<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-1441">WELD-1441</a>)</p>

<p>Therefore we reverted the commits done for WICKET-5226 and hope that
Glassfish will upgrade their Weld implementation soon. For the whole
story read

<h3 id="using-this-release">Using this release</h3>

<p>With Apache Maven update your dependency to (and donâ€™t forget to
update any other dependencies on Wicket projects to the same version):</p>
