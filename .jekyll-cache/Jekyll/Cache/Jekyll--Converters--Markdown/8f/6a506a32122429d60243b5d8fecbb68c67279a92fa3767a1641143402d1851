I"<p>The Apache Wicket team is proud to present the release of Apache Wicket
1.3.7. This will be the last feature release for the 1.3.x branch. Going
forward, only security fixes will be released in the 1.3.x branch - meaning
that 1.3.7 may be the last release in this branch. All users are encouraged
to upgrade to 1.4.0 as soon as possible. As work begins on 1.5 in the near
future, we will be supporting 1.4.x and 1.5.x.</p>

<h2 id="apache-wicket-137">Apache Wicket 1.3.7</h2>

<p>Apache Wicket is a component oriented Java web application framework. With
proper mark-up/logic separation, a POJO data model, and a refreshing lack of
XML, Apache Wicket makes developing web-apps simple and enjoyable again. Swap
the boilerplate, complex debugging and brittle code for powerful, reusable
components written with plain Java and HTML.</p>

<p>You can find out more about Apache Wicket on <a href="http://wicket.apache.org">our website</a></p>
