<h3 id="using-apache-maven">Using Apache Maven</h3>

<p>Use the following Maven dependency to use Wicket in your project:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span class="nt">&lt;dependency&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;groupId&gt;</span>org.apache.wicket<span class="nt">&lt;/groupId&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;artifactId&gt;</span>wicket<span class="nt">&lt;/artifactId&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;version&gt;</span>1.3.7<span class="nt">&lt;/version&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/dependency&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Add the snippet above to your projectâ€™s POM in the dependency
(management) section.</p>

<p>You can add more Wicket modules to your project by adding more
dependencies (copy above snippet and change the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">artifactId</code>
accordingly).</p>

<p>If you are not a Maven user, you can download the Wicket release manually.</p>

<h3 id="download-manually">Download Manually</h3>

<p>Use the following links to download Wicket manually to build Wicket
from source:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download source+bin <a href="https://archive.apache.org/dist/wicket/1.3.7/apache-wicket-1.3.7.tar.gz">apache-wicket-1.3.7.tar.gz</a>
(<a href="https://archive.apache.org/dist/wicket/1.3.7/apache-wicket-1.3.7.tar.gz.asc">PGP</a>,
<a href="https://archive.apache.org/dist/wicket/1.3.7/apache-wicket-1.3.7.tar.gz.md5">MD5</a>,
<a href="https://archive.apache.org/dist/wicket/1.3.7/apache-wicket-1.3.7.tar.gz.sha">SHA</a>
)</li>
  <li>Download source+bin <a href="https://archive.apache.org/wicket/1.3.7/apache-wicket-1.3.7.zip">apache-wicket-1.3.7.zip</a>
(<a href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/wicket/1.3.7/apache-wicket-1.3.7.zip.asc">PGP</a>,

)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the binary packages and the source packages donâ€™t contain any
dependencies necessary to have your project working out of the box. We
strongly urge you to use Maven (or Buildr, or Gradle) as your
dependency management system.</p>

<h3 id="older-releases">Older releases</h3>

<p>The Apache mirroring system only hosts the latest version of each actively supported branch.
When you need to download an older release you can find them in the archives.</p>

<p>Go to <a href="https://archive.apache.org/dist/wicket">the Apache archives</a> to find your specific version.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>Apache Wicket has few requirements in order to work properly. In this
section youâ€™ll find the minimum requirements for all Wicket modules.
Specific modules may need additional libraries, such as file upload,
date time APIs, CDI specifications, and more. See the moduleâ€™s POM for
more details on the necessary libraries.</p>

<h3 id="java-version">Java version</h3>

<p>This Wicket version requires at least the following Java version: <strong>JDK 1.4.0 or newer</strong>.</p>

<p>Not only is a particular version of Java necessary, Wicket also needs
access to specific APIs.</p>

<h3 id="servlet-api">Servlet API</h3>

<p>This Wicket version requires at least the following Servlet API
version: <strong>Servlet API 2.3 or newer</strong>. This is provided by your
container, please see the documentation of your container to see which
version of the Servlet specification is supported.</p>

<p>In addition to the Servlet API, Wicket uses SLF4J to let you choose
your own implementation of a logging framework.</p>

<h3 id="dont-mix-wicket-versions">Donâ€™t mix Wicket versions</h3>

<p>You cannot mix different Wicket versions in your project. You should
always use the artifacts from a particular release. For example it is
<strong>not</strong> possible to use Wicket Extensions 1.3 in a Wicket 1.5 project,
or Wicket Spring 1.4.19 in a Wicket 1.5 project. The same goes for 3rd
party libraries: make sure you always use a compatible version of your
3rd party library.</p>

<h2 id="migrating-from-earlier-versions">Migrating from earlier versions</h2>

<p>If you are migrating an existing application from earlier versions of
Wicket you may find our migration guides invaluable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Migrating from <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WICKET/Migrating+to+Wicket+1.3">Wicket 1.2 to Wicket 1.3</a></li>
</ul>
