<p>The Apache Software Foundation takes a very active stance in
eliminating security problems against the Apache Wicket web framework.</p>

<p>For reporting and discussing a security issue you should contact the
Wicket PMC privately.</p>

<p><strong>** PLEASE DO NOT CREATE A SECURITY REPORT IN OUR ISSUE TRACKER **</strong></p>

<p>The issue tracker for Wicket is not the appropriate venue for reporting
security issues as the issue tracker is publicly accessible. Instead,
contact the Wicket PMC privately.</p>

<h3 id="contact-the-wicket-pmc-privately">Contact the Wicket PMC privately</h3>

<p>Send your security issue to <strong>private at wicket.apache.org</strong>. This list
is not publicly available so we can discuss and fix the issue in
private without leaking the info to any bad guys.</p>

<p><a class="button" href="mailto:private@wicket.apache.org?subject=Security%20issue" onclick="window.location.href='mailto:private@wicket.apache.org?subject=Security%20issue';return false;">
    <i class="fa fa-shield"></i>
    REPORT A SECURITY ISSUE
</a></p>

<p>We treat all security issues seriously and will try to fix them as soon
as possible in all affected versions that we still support.</p>

<h3 id="report-normal-bugs-in-jira">Report normal bugs in JIRA</h3>

<p>The Security Team cannot accept regular bug reports or other queries,
we ask that you use our <a href="/help/#reportbug">bug reporting page</a>
for normal, non-security bugs.</p>
