The Apache Wicket PMC is proud to announce Apache Wicket 6.22.0!

This release marks another minor release of Wicket 6. We
use semantic versioning for the development of Wicket, and as such no
API breaks are present breaks are present in this release compared to
6.0.0.

### Using this release

With Apache Maven update your dependency to (and don't forget to
update any other dependencies on Wicket projects to the same version):

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
<groupId>org.apache.wicket</groupId>
<artifactId>wicket-core</artifactId>
<version>6.22.0</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight xml %}

Or download and build the distribution yourself, or use our
convenience binary package

 * Binery: [6.22.0 binary download](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/wicket/6.22.0/binaries)

### Upgrading from earlier versions

If you upgrade from 6.y.z this release is a drop in replacement. If
