title: Apache Wicket 7.5.0 released

The Apache Wicket PMC is proud to announce Apache Wicket 7.5.0!

Apache Wicket is an open source Java component oriented web application
framework that powers thousands of web applications and web sites for
governments, stores, universities, cities, banks, email providers, and
more. You can find more about Apache Wicket at https://wicket.apache.org

This release marks another minor release of Wicket 7. We
use semantic versioning for the development of Wicket, and as such no
API breaks are present breaks are present in this release compared to
7.0.0.
