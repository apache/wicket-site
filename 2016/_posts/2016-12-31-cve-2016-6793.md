title: CVE-2016-6793 Apache Wicket deserialization vulnerability
---

*Severity*: Low

*Vendor*: The Apache Software Foundation

*Versions Affected*: Apache Wicket 6.x and 1.5.x

*Description*: Depending on the ISerializer set in the Wicket application, 
it's possible that a Wicket's object deserialized from an untrusted source 
and utilized by the application to causes the code to enter in an infinite 
loop. Specifically, Wicket's DiskFileItem class, serialized by Kryo, allows 
an attacker to hack its serialized form to put a client on an infinite loop 
if the client attempts to write on the DeferredFileOutputStream attribute.

*Mitigation*: Upgrade to Apache Wicket 6.25.0 or 1.5.17
