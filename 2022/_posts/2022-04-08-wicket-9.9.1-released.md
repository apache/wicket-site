title: Apache Wicket 9.9.1 released
---
The Apache Wicket PMC is proud to announce Apache Wicket 9.9.1!

Apache Wicket is an open source Java component oriented web application
framework that powers thousands of web applications and web sites for
governments, stores, universities, cities, banks, email providers, and
more. You can find more about Apache Wicket at https://wicket.apache.org

This release marks another minor release of Wicket 9. We
use semantic versioning for the development of Wicket, and as such no
API breaks are present in this release compared to 9.0.0.

New and noteworthy
------------------

This hotfix reverts WICKET-6963 which causes MarkupException in some particular cases. 
(see https://lists.apache.org/thread/y0zthfw2on04sm9wpn60my3x53b8cb3n).
In addition, this release updates Spring Core dependency to version 5.3.18 which provides a fix 
for Spring4shell vulnerability (CVE-2022-22965).

NOTE: Wicket is NOT directly impacted by Spring4shell. Your application might be exposed to this 
vulnerability only if you use Spring web frameworks (i.e. Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux).


Using this release
------------------

With Apache Maven update your dependency to (and don't forget to
update any other dependencies on Wicket projects to the same version):

{% highlight xml%}
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.wicket</groupId>
    <artifactId>wicket-core</artifactId>
    <version>9.9.1</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight%}

Or download and build the distribution yourself, or use our
convenience binary package you can find here:

 * Download: http://wicket.apache.org/start/wicket-9.x.html#manually

Upgrading from earlier versions
-------------------------------

If you upgrade from 9.y.z this release is a drop in replacement. If
you come from a version prior to 9.0.0, please read our Wicket 9

Have fun!
